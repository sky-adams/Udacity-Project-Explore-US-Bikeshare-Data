# Bikeshare Data

## Date created
Created on April 22, 2025.

## Description
This project provides a text-based, interactive way to view both the raw data and analyses of bikeshare data from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). The data is from three US cities: New York City, Washington, and Chicago. It was created as part of my coursework for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree. I have not included the data files in this repository because, while the data is publicly available, the files have had initial data wrangling done by Udacity, and I don't want to publish their course materials without permission.

The code demonstrates my ability to use basic pandas functionality. The Udacity assignment contained a Python file template. I filled it in to provide the data viewing and analysis functionality.

## Quickstart
You will need bikeshare.py and the three data files (not included in this repo). Once downloaded, run `pip install pandas` (or `pip3 install pandas` on a Mac) to install the pandas module. Then run `python bikeshare.py` (or `python3 bikeshare.py` on a Mac) to run the program.
