# Bikeshare Data

## Date created
Created on April 22, 2025.

## Description
This project provides an interactive way to view both the raw data and analyses of bikeshare data from New York City, Washington, and Chicago. It was created as part of my coursework for Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree.

## Quickstart
You will need bikeshare.py and the three data files (not included in this repo). Once downloaded, run `pip install pandas` (or `pip3 install pandas` on a Mac) to install the pandas module. Then run `python bikeshare.py` (or `python3 bikeshare.py` on a Mac) to run the program.
